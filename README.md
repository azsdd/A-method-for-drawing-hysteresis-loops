A method for drawing hysteresis loops based on GoodNotes
  Sometimes drawing hysteresis loops based on measured data points can be hard. So, a tricky way to solve this for not-so-academic occasions is to use Goonnotes, "Shape Tool". The precedures are listed below:
  1. plot all the single points using Python.
  2. Seperate it into several Concave and convex curves.
  3. Use the shape function to draft each part.
  4. Adjust the reference points to make it smmoth, especially at the connection points.
